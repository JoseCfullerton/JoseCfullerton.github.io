    Lab 3,4,9

    Lab 3, Lab, and 4 have a very very practical use, for example, we used a vector and a loop to check for a word's definition and spelling. Also, Labs 3 & 4, show that inputting an input, for example, google sheets show that inputting user and how important it is for user input to be valid and usable so that the code needs to be reliable for the user. But my favorite lab is number 4, this is due to the fact that the practicality of making anything we want using code. We can virtually code and make any type of calculator, image emulator, or anything we want.
